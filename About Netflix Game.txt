About Netflix Clone App
This is Basic Netflix Clone App.
It Uses API promises.
I've created 'fetchMovies' function that takes(url, domelement, pathtype(poster or banner)) and use url of parameter to make promise, check wheather status is ok or not, if ok then return else
throw an error.
Use the data from promise made to pass it to 'showMovies' function as a parameter else throw an error.

Created 'showMovies' function that will take movies, domelement, pathtype as a parameter.
Take a moviesEl variable, used for loop to go through movies.result that is data from the API promises .
Created HTML 'img' element and put it to imageElement variable and then setAttribute('data-id',movie.id)
Set the imageElement.src
and appended it to moviesEl that we have created earlier.
And at last we have created 'getOriginals()','getTrendingNow()','getTopRated()' used url and pass it to dynamic function 'fetchmovies' function  that will make promises and return the response from it to showmoves function that will show data to DOM element.
